    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Oscar Wilde was an Irish writer and poet renowned for his wit, flamboyant style, and contributions to literature. Some of his most famous works include "The Picture of Dorian Gray," a novel exploring themes of vanity and moral corruption, and "The Importance of Being Earnest," a comedic play satirizing Victorian society. Wilde's sharp wit and criticism of societal norms have left a lasting legacy in both literature and popular culture.</p><br>
    <h2>Life</h2>
    <p>Oscar Wilde was born on October 16, 1854, in Dublin, Ireland. He studied at Trinity College Dublin and later at Oxford University, where he gained a reputation for his wit and intellectual prowess. Wilde became a prominent figure in London’s literary and social scenes during the late 19th century.
<br>
        His works, including plays, essays, and novels, earned him considerable acclaim. However, his career was marred by personal scandal. In 1895, Wilde was convicted of "gross indecency" due to his homosexual relationships, which were illegal at the time. He was sentenced to two years of hard labor, and his conviction led to a dramatic fall from grace.
      <br>  
        After his release in 1897, Wilde lived in exile in France under the name Sebastian Melmoth. He spent his final years in relative obscurity and financial difficulty, dying on November 30, 1900, in Paris at the age of 46. Despite the tragic end to his life, Wilde's work and his keen observations on society continue to be celebrated for their brilliance and enduring relevance.</p><br>
